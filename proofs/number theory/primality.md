## Primality
These proofs are related to prime numbers, their properties, and how they are related to other sets. Note that for all these proofs, $P$ represents the set of primes.

> **Therum p1**
> The greatest common devisor of any prime and any positive integer less than that prime is $1$.
> $\plet p\in P\implies \forall\;a\in\Z^+, \g(p, a)=1$ where $a<p$.
> 
> **Claim**: $\forall a\in\Z^+, \exists\;p \in P$ such that $p|a$.
> 
> **Proof:**
> $\plet p\in P$
> $\plet a\in\Z^+$ and $a<p$
> $\plet\g(a, p)=k$. This implies that
